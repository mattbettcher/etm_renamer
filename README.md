# etm_renamer
Simple program to rename Army (possible other services) Electronic Technical Manuals to their actual names.

You see manuals in the Army are named using a simple number scheme for use in the horrible ETM manager program (not actual name).
Most people prefer to browse directly in the folder with the manuals (PDFs). This means you must open the etm.txt file and decode the actual file name from inside the etm.txt file. This takes lots of time, there are hundreds of manuals.

This program simply does this for you.

Use:
* Copy PDF folder contents from ETM cd to where ever you keep your manuals.
* Copy the etm.txt file to the same place.
* Copy etm.exe to the same folder.
* Run etm.exe. It will prompt you with what files were changed.
